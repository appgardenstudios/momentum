## MVP

**Problem**: How do I get my project done when I don't have a lot of time to work on it?

**Solution**: You can complete any project by working on it consistently. Momentum helps you break a project down into bite-sized pieces so you can work on it every single day.

## Complete Projects

**Problem**: I've completed my project thanks to Momentum. How do I mark it done?

**Solution**: Congratulations and felicitations! Momentum lets you mark a project as done when you finish it.

## Multiple Projects

**Problem**: How do I work on multiple projects at the same time and still get things done?

**Solution**: You can still get projects done if you focus. Momentum helps you stay focused by helping you work on up to three projects at a time.
